<h2 align="center">  Overview </h2>

The **Digital Waters Consortium** is a Finnish flagship and PhD pilot uniting scientists, engineers, and policymakers to co-develop architectures, models, and methods that enable a comprehensive **digital twin of the hydrosphere** for data driven, sustainable water management.

Our mission is to make **water science and management reproducible, scalable, and generalizable** through open-source technologies, transparent data practices, and stakeholder-driven innovation.

<h2 align="center"> Core Objectives </h2>

### 1. Co-develop architectures and models to support a comprehensive, scalable, source-to-sea digital twin of the hydrosphere

* Build modular, interoperable, generalizable architectures for data-driven hydrologic digital twins.
* Integrate real-time sensor networks and 4D (3D + time) observations with physical models using interoperable data assimilation pipelines and AI-driven components.
* Promote FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open science principles in water-resources management.

### 2. Enable replicable and scalable research in digital water management

* Support transparent workflows and reproducible experiments
* Foster cloud-native, containerized, and distributed modeling frameworks
* Develop reusable digital assets (data, models, APIs, visualization tools)
* Encourage collaboration across disciplines — from IoT devices to networks to hydrology to policy

<h2 align="center"> Organizational Structure </h2>

The consortium operates through **collaborative Research Themes (RTs)**:

| Research Theme                              | Focus Area                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    **RT1: Hydrosphere processes**   | Re-evaluating past, present, and future hydrosphere processes  |
|    **RT2: New Observation Systems** | New observation network and autonomous multi-robot platforms for environmental monitoring of natural and built environments|
|    **RT3: Integrated analysis and modelling** | Integration of analysis tools and simulation models with observations and digital service platform for near real time simulation and impact assessments |
|    **RT4: Digital services, platforms, and business applications**  | Interoperable digital solutions for sharing and exploring data from sensors and models, and co-creation of services  |
|   **RT5: Transformative water management** | New avenues to improve water management and to create business innovations through digital solutions |
|   **Training & Capacity Building** | Digital Waters PhD Pilot and mutli-level training training on open science and best practices for research and infrastructure co-development in digital water management|


<h2 align="center"> Key Technologies</h2>

We build upon open architectures, including:

*  **Data and metadata interoperability** (OGC standards)
*  **Data & model interoperability** (pygeoapi, STAC, simpl, WaterML2.0, OpenMI)
*  **Interoperability with EU platforms** (STAC, Simpl, Kubernetes)
*  **AI for science** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
*  **FAIR workflows** (Docker, conda, pixi, git/GitHub, JupyterHub)
