# 🌍 DigitalWaters.fi

### *Collaboratively developing open, replicable, and scalable science for digital water management.*

---

## 💧 Overview

The **Digital Waters Consortium** is an open Finnish research initiative uniting scientists, engineers, and policymakers to co-develop architectures, models, and methods that enable a comprehensive **digital twin of the hydrosphere**.

Our mission is to make **water science and management reproducible, scalable, and generalizable** through open-source technologies, transparent data practices, and stakeholder-driven innovation.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Co-develop architectures and models to support a comprehensive, scalable, source-to-sea digital twin of the hydrosphere

* Build modular, interoperable architectures for hydrologic digital twins
* Integrate physical models, data assimilation pipelines, and AI-driven components
* Align with OGC interoperability standards
* Promote FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open science principles

### 2. Enable replicable and scalable research in digital water management

* Support transparent workflows and reproducible experiments
* Foster cloud-native, containerized, and distributed modeling frameworks
* Develop reusable digital assets (data, models, APIs, visualization tools)
* Encourage collaboration across disciplines — from hydrology to informatics

## 🧩 Organizational Structure

The consortium operates through **collaborative workstreams**:

| Workstream                              | Focus Area                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏗️ **Architecture & Infrastructure**   | Frameworks, APIs, data pipelines, cloud infrastructure         |
| 🌊 **Modeling & Simulation**            | Hydrologic, hydraulic, and hydrogeologic modeling              |
| 🤖 **AI & Data Assimilation**           | Machine learning, uncertainty quantification, sensor fusion    |
| 🗺️ **Interoperability & Standards**    | Metadata, ontologies, and compliance with open data standards  |
| 📈 **Use Cases & Applications**         | Basin-scale digital twins, urban water systems, extreme events |
| 📚 **Open Science & Capacity Building** | Training, reproducibility, and best practices                  |

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

* **Open collaboration** — all repositories are public by default
* **Reproducibility first** — versioned data, transparent workflows, documented environments
* **Interoperability by design** — consistent APIs, modular architecture, open standards
* **Ethical and sustainable data use** — privacy, stewardship, and long-term accessibility
* **Stakeholder-driven governance** — inclusive participation and shared ownership

---

## 🧰 Key Technologies

We build upon open ecosystems such as:

* 🌐 **Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)** standards
* ☁️ **Cloud-native computing** (Kubernetes, Dask, Prefect)
* 🧬 **Data & model interoperability** (Zarr, NetCDF, Xarray)
* 🧠 **AI for science** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
* 🧪 **Reproducible workflows** (Docker, GitHub Actions, Jupyter, CWL, Snakemake)
