<h3 align="center"></i> Collaboratively developing open, replicable, and scalable science for digital water management.* </h3>

<h2 align="center"> 💧 Overview </h2>

The **Digital Waters Consortium** is a Finnish flagship and PhD pilot uniting scientists, engineers, and policymakers to co-develop architectures, models, and methods that enable a comprehensive **digital twin of the hydrosphere** for data driven, sustainable water management.

Our mission is to make **water science and management reproducible, scalable, and generalizable** through open-source technologies, transparent data practices, and stakeholder-driven innovation.

<h2 align="center"> Core Objectives

### 1. Co-develop architectures and models to support a comprehensive, scalable, source-to-sea digital twin of the hydrosphere

* Build modular, interoperable architectures for hydrologic digital twins
* Integrate sensor networks and physical models, data assimilation pipelines, and AI-driven components
* Align with OGC interoperability standards
* Promote FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open science principles

### 2. Enable replicable and scalable research in digital water management

* Support transparent workflows and reproducible experiments
* Foster cloud-native, containerized, and distributed modeling frameworks
* Develop reusable digital assets (data, models, APIs, visualization tools)
* Encourage collaboration across disciplines — from hydrology to informatics

<h2 align="center"> Organizational Structure

The consortium operates through **collaborative workstreams**:

| Workstream                              | Focus Area                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    **Architecture & Infrastructure**   | automatic data pipelines, virtual research environment, and associated infrastructure  |
|    **Modeling & Simulation**           | Hydrologic, hydraulic, and water quality modeling              |
|    **AI & Data Assimilation**          | Machine learning, uncertainty quantification, sensor fusion    |
|    **Interoperability & Standards**    | Interoperability with international Digital Twins frameworks and compliance with OGC standards  |
|   **Use Cases & Applications**         | Stakeholder-driven digital water use cases or "virtual thematic labs" |
|   **Open Science & Capacity Building** | Training on open science and best practices for research and infrastructure co-development                  |

<h2 align="center"> Guiding Principles
* **Reproducibility first** — versioned data, transparent workflows, documented environments
* **Interoperability by design** — consistent APIs, modular architecture, open standards
* **Ethical and sustainable data use** — privacy, stewardship, and long-term accessibility
* **Stakeholder-driven governance** — inclusive participation and shared ownership

<h2 align="center"> Key Technologies
We build upon open architectures, including:
*  **Data and metadata interoperability** (OGC standards)
*  **Cloud-native computing** (Kubernetes)
*  **Data & model interoperability** (pygeoapi, WaterML2.0, OpenMI)
*  **AI for science** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
*  **Reproducible workflows** (Docker, conda, pixi, GitHub Actions, JupyterHub)
